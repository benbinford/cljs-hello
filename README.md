# hello

Template clojuresecript project with figwheel/cider nrepl integration

## Overview

lein figwheel new -- --reagent with emacs setup

## Setup

To get an intereactive development environment in emacs:

    cider-jack-in (C-c Meta-j)
    
    user> (cljs)

    Browser to http://localhost:3449

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein do clean, cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.
